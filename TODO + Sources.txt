TODO:
- Dryrun mode
- Check: can a file and a folder have exactly the same name in 2 different places? (if yes, bug in make_tree)
- How to check if file content is the same without getting all their hashes? (slow...)
- Management of symlinks
- Management of permissions
- Async?


REVIEW:
- Review os.path functions + os.stat
